# WeatherForecast

- Experimented a bit with views, it think it turned out fine in the end. This took a bit more time but i wanted to have a bit of fun.
- Design is not the best - done on the fly, haven't put any thought in it.
- How to run: Just clone the project and run it :)
- EDIT: Forgot to add, only the forecast for London will be fetched. That's hardcoded in the API call, there is no interface for the user to choose a city.
